This R project creates the figures found in Williams, Funk, and Shukla 2023. The .rmd file contains the script to create the figures, using data found in the data folder. 

Haven't used Rmarkdown? Tips:
- Download .zip of all files in repo 
- On your computer, open the .Rproj file
- Open the .Rmd file in the project (this is the Rscript)
- At the top of the screen, click "knit"
