This R project creates the figures found in Williams, Funk, and Shukla 2023. The .rmd file contains the script to create the figures, using data found in the data folder. 

Haven't used Rmarkdown? Tips:
- On this page (on github), click the green 'code' button and download .zip of all files in repo.
- On your computer, unzip the .zip folder, then double click on .Rproj file to open the R project. 
- Open the .Rmd file in the project (this is the Rscript).
- At the top of the screen, click "knit."
